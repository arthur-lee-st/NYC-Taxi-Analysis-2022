# NYC-Taxi-Analysis-2022

This is my first personal project using Apache Spark. I've initially created the notebook analysis using DataBricks. Once that's completed, I ran it locally, followed by uploading it to Kaggle.

Third-party libraries used:
1. Numpy - https://github.com/numpy/numpy
2. Pandas - https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas
3. KeplerGL - https://github.com/keplergl/kepler.gl
